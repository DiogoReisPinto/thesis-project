\section{Objectives}

The main objective of this thesis is to design a process for project and evolving maintenance requests management that arrive to an information systems department of an organization. This process should be designed taking in account the background of a specific organization, but is as more interesting as more generally applicable it is.\par
Based in the process we want to design, we also need to define the activities that belong to it and assign responsibilities through an RACI Matrix (Responsibility Assignment Matrix). These responsibilities need to take as basis the organization structure in terms of roles and responsibilities. The supporting artifacts to the process will also be defined according to its importance to each activity belonging to it.\par
After designing the process and the respective RACI matrix and supporting artifacts, the objective is to design a logical application architecture for supporting the process, based on the existent market solutions for project and maintenance management. This architecture must be able to fully support and integrate the designed processes in the global structure of the organization, being able to be directly applied.
